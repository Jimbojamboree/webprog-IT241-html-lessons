  <h1>Welcome to my Oguri Cap guide for Umamusume: Pretty Derby!</h1>
  <h2>Race Guides</h2>
  <p>Oguri has an A aptitude in both Pace and Late, 
    it's better to run her as a Pace chaser with maxxing out her 
    speed and having at least an A or S rank in Stamina

  <h2>Support Cards</h2>
  <p>Kitasan Black SSR MLB is an absolute MUST when playing any racer who 
    runs in the current meta, she also runs well with pace chaser or late chaser cards like Eishin Flash SR, Tokai Teio SSR, Biko Pegasus SSR, etc. 
  Super Creek SSR is also really good to keep her stamina up in the A Ranks.</p>
